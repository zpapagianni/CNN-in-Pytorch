# Brain Tumor Classification-CNN using Pytorch

## Description
This repository contains a jupyter notebook that I used to analyse the data for [Brain Tumor Detection](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/navoneel/brain-mri-images-for-brain-tumor-detection).
It consists of MRI scans of two classes:

* YES - tumor, encoded as 1.
* NO - no tumor, encoded as 0.

The main purpose of this project is to build a CNN model that will classify the images as having a tumour or not.
The data set description doesn't hold any more information. It contains 2 folders: yes and no, with 253 brain MRI Images saved as jpeg.The folder yes contains 155 Brain MRI images that are tumorous and the folder no contains 98 Brain MRI Images that are non-tumorous.

The aim of this study is to analyse the monthly residential energy consumption in the US, since January 2000. The analysis contains parts:

* Data cleaning.
* Image Resizing.
* Visualisations.
* CNN Model.
* Results.

Here are the different files:
